ScringoChatClientWithParseSample-iOS
====================================

This sample contains all the libraries it requires, including __Scringo__ and Facebook SDK, except for Parse.  
It is assumed you're familiar with Parse for iOS.

To make it work you need to:  
1. Download the sample.  
2. Open with Xcode.  
3. Replace @"YOUR SCRINGO APP ID" in __AppDelegate.m__ with your Scringo App Id (See below how to obtain it if you don't have one already).  
4. Replace @"YOUR PARSE APP ID" in __AppDelegate.m__ with your Parse App Id and @"YOUR PARSE CLIENT ID" with your Parse client Id.  
5. If you're interested in Facebook integration, add your Facebook App Id in __ChatClientWithParse-Info.plist__ (See below how to do that).  
6. Run.  

To obtain a __Scringo__ App Id you need to sign up with __Scringo__ and create your first App. Follow the instructions in http://docs.scringo.com/ios-guides/hello/ to achieve that.

To define and use Facebook SDK within the App you need to follow the instructions listed here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/.

Good Luck
